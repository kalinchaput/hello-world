Hi Everyone!

My name is Kalin and I'm originally from Wisconsin. I now reside in West Hollywood and currently work as a medical coder. No, not the kind of coder you may be thinking. Think more of insurance and interpreting provider documention to translate that into "codes" to submit to insurance companies for reimbursement. 

I am very interested in learning this type of code and can't wait to see what types of scripts I can create.
